Joined Inputs
=================

Simple jQuery plugin to make several inputs act like one.
For example for card or phone number fields in your form.

1. Caret moves to next input if maximum length (taken from `maxlength` attribute) of current is reached (autotab).
2. Caret jumps to next or previous input on `right/left arrow keys` if caret at the end/beginning of current field.
3. Delete chars with `Backspace` works through all joined fields.
4. `Home` makes caret jump to first position in first input, `End` â€” to last position in last input.
5. Correctly works with `Tab` and `Shift+Tab`
